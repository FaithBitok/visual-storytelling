# visual-storytelling
Enhancing visual storytelling with DALL·E AI empowers K–12 teachers to bring lessons to life by quickly generating age-appropriate, curriculum-aligned images from historically accurate scenes and scientific diagrams to imaginative settings for creative writing prompts while supporting differentiated instruction and multilingual classrooms. By modeling prompt-writing and involving students in co-creating visuals, educators can strengthen visual literacy, spark engagement, and give learners ownership of their narratives; generated images can be adapted for formative assessments, graphic organizers, and accessible materials for diverse learners. Thoughtful classroom guidelines ensure ethical use: vetting content for accuracy and safety, protecting student privacy, addressing bias in outputs, and teaching students how AI shapes media so they become critical creators and consumers. Used as a tool within a larger pedagogy, DALL·E can expand creative possibilities and deepen understanding across subjects while reinforcing digital citizenship and inclusive representation.
